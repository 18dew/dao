Standard contracts used throughout the entire framework.

* [Assertions](#assertions)
* [Collections](#collections)
* [Errors](#errors)

### Assertions

Contracts needed for making assertions (sol-unit compatible).

### Collections

A set of standard collections. The key and value types are mostly `address` and `bytes32`. `bytes32` is a fixed size byte array, which can serve as a string, number or other things, and is therefore referred to as `property` in this library.

### Errors

Contracts used to handle errors.
